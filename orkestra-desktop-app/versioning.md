# Versioning

The Orkestra Online platform automatically keeps track of all the versions of a definition. You can, at any time, browse the history of a given definition. That will give you information about all the updates that occured, their date and time and the name of the person who updated it.

## Browse a definition's history

In order to browse a definition's history:&#x20;

&#x20;  1\. Selection the definition in the "Online Workspaces" window&#x20;

&#x20;  2\. Right click on it and click ![versionHistory](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/versionhistory.png?) &#x20;

## Rollback to a Specific Version

If you wish to rollback to a previous version of a definition, select it in the list of versions and press ![rollback](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/rolback.png?)

```diff
Doing this will delete all versions that are more recent than the selected one. This operation is irreversible
```

## Save a Specific Version of the Definition

You can recover an older version of a definition by selecting it and pressing ![saveAs](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/saveas.png?) This will let you save it in the location of your choice, without changing anything to the version history of the definition on the platform.

## Checkout a specific version of the definition in Dynamo

You can also checkout any version of a definition right from dynamo using the Orkestra Online Dynamo View Extension.
