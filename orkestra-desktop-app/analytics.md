# Analytics

Everytime a definition is played through the[ **Orkestra Online Player Tab of the Orkestra Revit Addin**](../orkestra-revit-addin/orkestra-online-player-tab.md), some data is pushed to the platform. That data can be analysed directly from Orkestra in the **Analytics** window.

## Filtering Options

All these charts can be filtered using the built in filtering options. You can - for now - filter the data by [Hub](https://github.com/MostafaElAyoubi/Orkestra\_Online/wiki/What-is-a-Hub%3F), [Workspace](https://github.com/MostafaElAyoubi/Orkestra\_Online/wiki/What-is-a-Workspace) and time period (from date to date). Some more filters will be available in the future releases of Orkestra Online. The Filters apply to the charts in real time:&#x20;
