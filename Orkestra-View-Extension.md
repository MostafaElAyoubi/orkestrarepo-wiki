The Orkestra View Extension for Dynamo is an integration that lets you check out any version of a definition from your Orkestra Online storage and load it back in there in a seamless way. It keeps track of all modifications and also lets you edit the meta data and documentation associated to the definition right from Dynamo through a dedicated panel. You can also automatically snap a screenshot of the defnition and add it to the documentation of the application so users can look at it before  using it.
