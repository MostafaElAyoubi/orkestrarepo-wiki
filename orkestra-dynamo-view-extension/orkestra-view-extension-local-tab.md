# Orkestra View Extension Local Tab

The **Local Player Tab of the Orkestra Dynamo View Extension** is a very convenient **browser** for definitions located on your computer or on your server. 

**It does not require you to log in to Orkestra** or even have an internet connexion. It lets you **browse, search and open that are located on your computer** or your server.

The **Local Tab** is represented by this logo : ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)
