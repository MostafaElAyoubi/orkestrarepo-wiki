# Orkestra View Extension Local Tab

The **Local Player Tab of the Orkestra Dynamo View Extension** is a very convenient **browser** for definitions located on your computer or on your server. 

**It does not require you to log in to Orkestra** or even have an internet connexion. It lets you **browse, search and open that are located on your computer** or your server.

The **Local Tab** is represented by this logo : ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

In the **Content TreeView**, folders are represented by a "![folder](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/workspace.png?)" and Dynamo definitions by a "![def](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/definition.png?)".

The Local Player Tab of the Orkestra Revit Addin is more convenient to use that the Dynamo Player because:

* It is a dockable pane that integrate better with Revit
* It lets you set up tree structures in a very easy way \(no need to continuously browse to different folders\)
