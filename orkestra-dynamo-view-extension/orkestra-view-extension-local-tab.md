# Orkestra View Extension Local Tab

The **Local Player Tab of the Orkestra Dynamo View Extension** is a very convenient **browser** for definitions located on your computer or on your server.&#x20;

**It does not require you to log in to Orkestra** or even have an internet connexion. It lets you **browse, search and open that are located on your computer** or your server.

The **Local Tab** is represented by this logo : <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt="" data-size="original">&#x20;

In the **Content Browser**, folders are represented by a "![folder](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/workspace.png?)" and Dynamo definitions by a "![def](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/definition.png?)".
