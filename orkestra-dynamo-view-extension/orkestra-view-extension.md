# Introduction

The Orkestra View Extension for Dynamo is an integration that lets you :

* **Check out any version** of a definition from your Orkestra Online storage 
* **Load definitions to the Orkestra platform** and deploy them in a seamless way.
* **Read and Edit  the Metadata and documentation** associated to the definition right from Dynamo through a dedicated panel. 
* **Automatically document your definition** by associating snapshots of the definition/3D background 
* **Easily compare versions of a same definition** \(node addition, deletion and modification\) with a visual interface.
