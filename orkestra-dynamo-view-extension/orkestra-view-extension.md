# Introduction

The Orkestra View Extension for Dynamo is an integration that lets you :

* **Check out any version** of a definition from your Orkestra Online storage&#x20;
* **Load definitions to the Orkestra platform** and deploy them in a seamless way.
* **Read and Edit  the Metadata and documentation** associated to the definition right from Dynamo through a dedicated panel.&#x20;
* **Automatically document your definition** by associating snapshots of the definition/3D background&#x20;
* **Easily compare versions of a same definition** (node addition, deletion and modification) with a visual interface.
