## Adding Users or Groups to the Enterprise App in AAD

### 1. Access the Enterprise Apps list through the AAD Portal

### 5. Click under the "Users" or "Groups" sections , then search and select the user/group to add

The great thing about this is being able to leverage all your AAD user database, as well a pre-existing groups. For example, if you already have a "Revit Users" group, you could reuse it to manage access to Orkestra.

### 6. Once you're done selecting users/groups, click on the "Assign" button to complete the operation

From now on, the users/groups selected can log in to Orkestra Online using the Log in wth SSO button
