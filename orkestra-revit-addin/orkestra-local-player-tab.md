# Orkestra Local Player Tab

The **Local Player Tab of the Orkestra Revit Addin** is basically a Dynamo Player. 

**It does not require you to log in to Orkestra** or even have an internet connexion. It lets you **play definitions that are located on your computer** or your server using your **local package settings**.

The **Local Tab** is represented by this logo : ![local](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/localicon.png?)

In the **Content TreeView**, folders are represented by a "![folder](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/workspace.png?) " and Dynamo definitions by a "![def](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/definition.png?) ".

## Setting Local Workspaces

The Local Player Tab of the Orkestra Revit Addin is more convenient to use that the Dynamo Player because:

* It is a dockable pane that integrate better with Revit
* It lets you set up tree structures in a very easy way \(no need to continuously browse to different folders\)
