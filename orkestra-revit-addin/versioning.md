# Versioning

The Orkestra Online platform automatically keeps track of all the versions of a definition. You can, at any time, browse the history of a given definition. That will give you informations about all the updates that occured, their date and time and the name of the person who updated it.

## Browse a definition's history <a id="browse-a-definitions-history"></a>

In order to browse a definition's history:

 1. Selection the definition in the "Online Workspaces" window

 2. Right click on it and click ![versionHistory](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/versionhistory.png?)

You can also checkout any version of a definition right from dynamo using the Orkestra Online Dynamo View Extension.
