# Definition MetaData and Documentation

## Introduction

One of the most powerful things in Orkestra Online is how it makes **documenting** and **referencing** a definition convenient. You can associate Metadata to the definitions as well as documentation files of all sorts and centralize that information on the platform.

## Definitions Metadata

There are many informations associated to the definition when it's on the Orkestra Online platform. Some of that metadata is generated and updated automatically, making it fully reliable. Some other informations are to be entered by the creator of the definition to better communicate with the users.

### Version <a id="version"></a>

The Orkestra Online platform **automatically keeps track of file versions**. The current version of a file is displayed on the Properties Pannel. More on definition versionning here!

### Last update <a id="last-update"></a>

**At each update of a definition, the date and time is saved automatically**. That lets you and your users know exactly when the last modification occured. This information is also displayed on the Properties Pannel.

### Last updated by <a id="last-updated-by"></a>

It is always crucial to know who updated a definition. That helps improve reliability and accountability. Knowing who last updated a definition decreases the time spent looking on informations about that update as it points you at the most appropriate person te talk to. **This information is automatically associated with the definitions at each update** and is also displayed on the Properties Pannel.

### Key Words <a id="key-words"></a>

Key Workds can be associated to a definition by it's creator/ administrator in order to reference it. Key Words allow definition sorting as well as searching. To edit the Key Words, you must be an administrator of the Workspace that contains the definition. All you have to do is: 1. Right Click on the definition and click ![info](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fileinfo.png?)

### Description <a id="description"></a>

A definition name is not always enough to understand exactlyy what a definition does. That is why Orkestra Online lets you also associate a description to a definition. That description will appear on the Properties Pannel to let the users better understand the effect/ requirements of a definition. The description also appears on the tooltip of **Online QuickAccesses**. To edit the Description, you must be an administrator of the Workspace that contains the definition. All you have to do is: 1. Right Click on the definition and click ![info](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fileinfo.png?)

## Associate Documentation to a Definitions <a id="associate-documentation-to-a-definitions"></a>

Key Workds and Descriptions are great. But most of the times a picture or a video speaks a thousand words. Thats why you can also associate Documentation Files of all kinds to the definitions. They are very easilly reachable through the Properties Pannel as clickable hyperlinks. Clicking on a file in the list will download and open it:

## Automated Graph and Background SnapShots <a id="automated-graph-and-background-snapshots"></a>

When uploaded through the [Orkestra Online Dynamo View Extension](https://github.com/MostafaElAyoubi/Orkestra_Online/wiki/Orkestra-Dynamo-View-Extension-:-Uploading-Definitions), definitions can have automatically generated snapshots of the graph and the background geometry associated to them. When those snapshots are available, they can be visualized \(if you're an admin of the Workspace containing the definition\) from the Properties Pannel :
