# HUB 
Every **Orkestra Online** account has an associated "Hub". 
A Hub is a storage space where you can load and organize your Dynamo definitions. It is represented by a " ![cloud](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/cloudi.png?resize=30%2C20) " in the "Online Workspaces" window.
**If you are the owner/ an administrator of the Hub**, you can view and edit it's **settings** 
To edit the Hub settings:
1. Select the Hub in the "Online Workspaces" window 
2. Click on ![settings](https://datashapes.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/hub-settings.png?) . This button will only be enabled if your are the owner/ an administrator of the Hub.

## User settings

In the Hub settings, you can specify which user gets access to it's content. The list of users and their level of access is diplayed here:

**If someone has access to a Hub, they have acces to ALL THE CONTENT OF THE HUB.**

You can easilly manage the users through this window:

### Add users to the Hub
1. Click on 
2. Enter the email of the user you wish to add (they need to have an Orkestra Online account) and specify their role.

!-Note that - for now - every person invited to a Hub will have an "Admin" role. There is no "User" role at Hub level. (Looking forward to collect feedback and this particular point)-!
### Delete users from the Hub
